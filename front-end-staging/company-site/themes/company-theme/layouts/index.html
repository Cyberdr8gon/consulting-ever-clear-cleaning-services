          <p>
            Utilizing only highly filtered and de-ionized water, we clean your windows with no chemicals! We can go anywhere up to 3 stories high with our water-fed pole. We completely remove the dirt, and only clean water is left to evaporate. This makes for a lasting shine with no soap residue that mixes with rain to stain at a later date. We love residential customers as well as commercial customers. Everyone can benefit from a better looking home or business!

          <h2>Solar Panel Cleaning</h2>
          <p>
            Solar panels get much less effective when they get dirty. What looks like even just a small coating of dust makes solar panels less effective, decreasing the amount of energy they can produce for you. What is worse, is that the companies that sell you these only test completely clean solar panels when projecting energy production of the panels.
